# About me

Hello, world! My name is Rosy Díaz. I'm from the Dominican Republic, a gorgeous island in the Caribbean, currently living in the Washington DC metro area.

I’m a full stack developer with a background in teaching English as a Second Language and working as a Customer Service Representative. My technical skills include JavaScript, Python, React, jQuery, Node, Express, Django, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I have used these technologies to build web applications, which you can check out on the 'Projects' section!

The skills that I acquired in my previous jobs and have implemented in my new role as a software engineer include leadership, active listening, problem solving, communication, critical thinking, patience, and organization.

Some of the things I like to do for fun are reading, baking and riding a bike. I love cats (something you'll notice after checking out my 'Plenty of Cats' website!) and have 2 that make me very happy whenever they actually let me anywhere near them. Other things I enjoy are drinking iced coffee and being a grammar nerd.
